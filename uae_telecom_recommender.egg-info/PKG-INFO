# UAE Telecom Recommender System

A sophisticated, sector-aware recommender system designed specifically for project risk management in UAE telecommunications infrastructure. This modular system provides comprehensive risk assessment and actionable recommendations across 10 key telecom sectors.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture supporting:

### üéØ 10 UAE Telecom Sectors
1. **Network Infrastructure** (15% weight) - Core network equipment, towers, fiber optics
2. **Cybersecurity** (12% weight) - Security threats, compliance, data protection  
3. **Telecom Services** (13% weight) - Voice, data, internet services
4. **IT Software & Development** (12% weight) - Software development, system integration
5. **Regulatory Compliance** (11% weight) - UAE regulations, licensing, policy compliance
6. **Customer Service & Delivery** (10% weight) - Customer support, service delivery
7. **Supply Chain Management** (9% weight) - Procurement, vendor management
8. **Marketing & Sales** (8% weight) - Campaigns, customer acquisition
9. **Research & Development** (8% weight) - Innovation, technology development
10. **Human Resources** (7% weight) - Workforce management, training

### üîß Core Components
- **Risk Manager**: Central risk assessment engine
- **Sector Modules**: Specialized risk assessment for each sector
- **Configuration System**: UAE-specific settings and parameters
- **Recommendation Engine**: ML-powered recommendation generation
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for system interaction

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hansvitalic/uae_telecom_recommender_system.git
cd uae_telecom_recommender_system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## üìã Quick Start

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Get help
uae-telecom-recommender --help

# List all available sectors
uae-telecom-recommender sectors

# Show UAE regulatory context
uae-telecom-recommender context

# Run assessment on sample project
uae-telecom-recommender sample --project-type network_upgrade

# Assess a custom project
uae-telecom-recommender assess \
  --project-id "UAE_PROJECT_2024" \
  --description "5G network expansion in Dubai" \
  --budget 50000000 \
  --timeline-days 365 \
  --complexity 0.8 \
  --technologies "5G,Fiber Optic,Edge Computing" \
  --stakeholders "Etisalat,Dubai Municipality,TRA" \
  --output summary
```

### Python API Usage

```python
from uae_telecom_recommender import TelecomRecommenderSystem
from uae_telecom_recommender.sectors.base_sector import ProjectData

# Initialize the system
recommender = TelecomRecommenderSystem()

# Create project data
project = ProjectData(
    project_id="UAE_5G_2024",
    sector_id="network_infrastructure",
    description="5G network rollout across UAE",
    budget=75000000,  # 75M AED
    timeline_days=548,  # 18 months
    complexity_score=0.8,
    stakeholders=["Etisalat", "du", "TRA"],
    technologies=["5G NR", "Massive MIMO", "Edge Computing"],
    dependencies=["Spectrum allocation", "Site permits"]
)

# Conduct risk assessment
report = recommender.assess_project(project)

# Print results
print(f"Overall Risk: {report.overall_risk:.1%} ({report.risk_category})")
print(f"Top Risk Factors: {[risk[0] for risk in report.top_risks[:3]]}")
```

## üåç UAE-Specific Features

### Regulatory Compliance
- **UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA)** integration
- **UAE Cyber Security Law** compliance checking
- **UAE Data Protection Law** considerations
- Critical infrastructure protection guidelines

### Risk Assessment Framework
- UAE-specific environmental factors (sandstorms, extreme heat)
- Local regulatory requirements and penalties
- Cultural and business context considerations
- Emergency response procedures aligned with UAE authorities

### Sector Weighting
Sectors are weighted based on their importance to UAE telecom infrastructure:
- Higher weights for critical infrastructure (Network, Cybersecurity)
- Regulatory compliance given significant weight due to UAE legal framework
- Customer service weighted appropriately for competitive UAE market

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=uae_telecom_recommender

# Run specific test category

## üìä Sample Output

```
Project: UAE_NET_2024_001
Generated: 2024-01-15T10:30:45

Overall Risk Level: 72.3% (HIGH)
Risk Bar: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë]

Sector Risk Assessment:
Network Infrastructure        78.5%
Cybersecurity                 69.2%
Regulatory Compliance         65.8%
Supply Chain Management       58.3%

Top Risk Factors:
1. Equipment failure (Network Infrastructure, 78.5%)
2. Cyber attacks (Cybersecurity, 69.2%)
3. Regulatory violations (Regulatory Compliance, 65.8%)

Priority Recommendations:
